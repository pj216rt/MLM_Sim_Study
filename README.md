The purpose of this project is to derive a novel method to identify and estimate latent variables in a two level longitudinal model.  This work is comprised of four main .R files.  The first serves as a repository for functions that will be used throughout the project.  The second generates simulated data.  The third runs STAN sampling on these generated datasets using the cmdstan R package.  The fourth analyzes the sampled results.
