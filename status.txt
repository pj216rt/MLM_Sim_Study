This weekend, I spent a good deal of time getting the stan files updated.
There were 11 stan files that we are looking at: 

1.) uninformative prior
2.) Ridge prior
3.) Local Students t prior
4.) LASSO prior
5.) Elastic net prior
6.) Group LASSO prior
7.) Hyper-LASSO prior
8.) Horseshoe prior
9.) Regularized horseshoe prior
10.) Bernoulli discrete normal mixture prior
11.) Uniform discrete normal mixture prior

For some of these, the procedure was as simple as modifying the code that van
Erp provided.  In other cases, I had to tweak the format due to the fact that
van Erp used vectors of predictors and we have a matrix.  

I have questions about how to best impliment the Group Lasso prior.  Without
any strict grouping design, this prior simply becomes the regular lasso.

Attempts to compile the uniform discrete normal mixture prior have resulted in
an odd error message: ***INSERT THE EXACT MESSAGE HERE***

I also have concerns about the generated quantities block in the stan files.
I am afraid that we are not taking into account the multivariate normal
distribution when we utilize the random number generator.  Should we include
this?

I just started this weekend by working on implimenting an efficiency change
that I discovered over the 4th of July break into the other STAN files.  In
short, by utilizing Cholensky factorization, I am able to keep the number of
divergent transitions to below 1.0% of all transitions.  This isn't perfect,
but it allows for a higher effective sample size in the STAN sampling.

As of 10pm tonight, I have tweaked the ridge prior, the students t prior, the
lasso prior and the horseshoe prior.

I drove back from NC today, so I did not do much in terms of the project.  I
did however, get Github to work finally.  This means that there should be a
huge rush of changes to the files as I add, commit, and push the main working
files.
